# Single Page App demo in Clojure, Ring, Compojure and Reagent/Inertia.js

Example to demonstrate the use of [Inertia-Clojure](https://github.com/prestancedesign/inertia-clojure) + [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/).

I forked the [usermanager-example](https://github.com/seancorfield/usermanager-example) repository, a back-end web application and a few basic modifications are enough to
transform it to a Single Page Application.

You can check the commit diff of what it took to change the app to SPA (for the back-end): [commit/9e4bfb86d610d7467ef506981da68ec597bd31f3](https://github.com/prestancedesign/usermanager-reagent-inertia-example/commit/9e4bfb86d610d7467ef506981da68ec597bd31f3)

For convenience, the repository already contains the bundled front-end [resources/public/assets/js/app.js](resources/public/assets/js), so it can be tried quickly.
For those who want to play with the client side, just go to the [front](front/) directory and run `npm i && npx shadow-cljs watch app`.

All Reagent components are located in this [file](front/src/reagent/inertia.cljs).

## Usage

Clone the repo, `cd` into it, then follow below to _Run the Application_ or _Run the application in REPL_

### Run the Application

    $ clj -M -m usermanager.main

It should create a SQLite database (`usermanager_db`) and populate two tables (`department` and `addressbook`) and start a Jetty instance on port 8080.

If that port is in use, start it on a different port. For example, port 8100:


    $ clj -M -m usermanager.main 8100

### Run the Application in REPL

Start REPL

    $ clj

Once REPL starts, start the server as an example on port 8888:

```clj
user=> (require 'usermanager.main)                             ; load the code
user=> (in-ns 'usermanager.main)                               ; move to the namesapce
usermanager.main=> (def system (new-system 8888))              ; specify port
usermanager.main=> (alter-var-root #'system component/start)   ; start the server
```
